Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.\n",

        "Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices. Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.\n",
        "Yes.\n",
        "Really.\n",
        "Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.\n",
        "That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18. Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.\n",

        "No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.\n",
        "You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.\n",
        "That's right. Not my style, Reggie..\n",
        "And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?\n",
        "It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out. There's nothin' to talk about.\n",
        "Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand. Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.\n",
        "Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick. You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...\n",
        "Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.\n",
        "You okay?\n",
        "Well, you got to admit we come a long way.\n",
        "Partnership?\n",
        "Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.\n",
        "Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...\n",
        "If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.\n",
        "Whatever play I maker just back me up.\n",
        "Hey, there she is...\n",
        "I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.\n",
        "What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.\n",
        "If she's right, and if you don't screw up.\n",
        "Do I get to kiss her too? Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...\n",
        "Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him... Don't worry about it.\n",
        "It's late, they're closing... Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.\n",
        "Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.\n",
        "Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.\n",
        "I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.\n",
        "Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.\n",
        "I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.\n",
        "Hey, how'd my car get here?\n",
        "Yeah. It missed the last four stops.\n",
        "Notice something funny about that bus? Luther's on the move...\n",
        "Why?\n",
        "When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.\n",
        "That was quick.\n",
        "I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.\n",
        "Yeah, I see her. Yeah. Guess not.\n",
        "Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...\n",
        "Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.\n",
        "You sure that's the reason?\n",
        "I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...\n",
        "Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...\n",
        "Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split? So you took the rest of the night off...\n",
        "They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the \"Don't Disturb\" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind. Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.\n",
        "Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.\n",
        "You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.\n",
        "We missed.\n",
        "What about Ganz?\n",
        "What about Luther? Hello. And goodbye.\n",
        "Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.\n",
        "Where's luther? I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?\n",
        "Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers. No way...\n",
        "You stay with me...\n",
        "Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.\n",
        "Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.\n",
        "That was in style a couple years back, man.\n",
        "Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?\n",
        "We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?\n",
        "Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.\n",
        "No class...\n",
        "What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.\n",
        "You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.\n",
        "Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...\n",
        "A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row... If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.\n",
        "Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...\n",
        "You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...\n",
        "I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...\n",
        "Doesn't it get... Tiring?\n",
        "If they don't tell me what I need to know...\n",
        "Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?\n",
        "That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.\n",
        "I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.\n",
        "I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you... Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?\n",
        "I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.\n",
        "If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.\n",
        "Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.\n",
        "You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.\n",
        "I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.\n",
        "Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.\n",
        "Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash? Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.\n",
        "Musta got some primo bondsman.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "Guess what?  Luther just got in line.\n",
        "Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.\n",
        "You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time. Shit.\n",
        "I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.\n",
        "You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.\n",
        "You just drove by it.\n",
        "...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.\n",
        "This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked. You're a real case, you know that, Jack?\n",
        "Where's the goddamn car? Yeah.  Right.\n",
        "Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.\n",
        "Right, partner.\n",
        "In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?\n",
        "Where's the money? Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.\n",
        "You gonna let me keep any of it?\n",
        "Not likely, convict.\n",
        "We split 50-50? You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?\n",
        "He's after your money.\n",
        "Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.\n",
        "Just tell me about the money. Jesus.\n",
        "Half a million.\n",
        "How much?\n",
        "I been waiting a long time for some money. One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.\n",
        "They saved your ass, convict.\n",
        "Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.\n",
        "Yeah, right.  You want to try again? Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...\n",
        "Maybe I don't like the way you ask.\n",
        "Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...\n",
        "I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.\n",
        "You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...\n",
        "You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.\n",
        "This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.\n",
        "Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...\n",
        "Let's go. Come on.\n",
        "Must be billy's girl.\n",
        "There. While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.\n",
        "You made that move, huh?\n",
        "Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.\n",
        "That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.\n",
        "My kind of place. I always liked country boys.\n",
        "This place don't seem real popular with the brothers. I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.\n",
        "I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge. The bet's off.\n",
        "I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.\n",
        "You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.\n",
        "What are you talkin' about?\n",
        "I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.\n",
        "That's never been one of my problems.\n",
        "Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.\n",
        "If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...\n",
        "I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.\n",
        "Hey, you wanna bet?\n",
        "You need five years training to handle a joint like...\n",
        "I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...\n",
        "Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...\n",
        "But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...\n",
        "If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...\n",
        "Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?\n",
        "This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...\n",
        "It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.\n",
        "Well?\n",
        "At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?\n",
        "Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.\n",
        "You have a good time?\n",
        "Last night.\n",
        "Last night, two nights ago, three?\n",
        "I don't give out the details.\n",
        "Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.\n",
        "Now, where we goin', convict? She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?\n",
        "You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?\n",
        "Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.\n",
        "Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station? Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.\n",
        "Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.\n",
        "Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...\n",
        "We eat when I say we eat.\n",
        "Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.\n",
        "Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn \"trim\" hunt... stop moaning.\n",
        "Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.\n",
        "We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.\n",
        "If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?\n",
        "He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.\n",
        "I think you better put him on ice, man.\n",
        "What do you think? Want to try it again?\n",
        "Thank you.\n",
        "Hey, this works pretty good. Just throw me the Goddamn gun.\n",
        "I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.\n",

        "Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.\n",
        "Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?\n",
        "Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.\n",
        "I may call you worse than that.\n",
        "Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....\n",
        "I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.\n",
        "Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.\n",

        "Luther was part of the gang?\n",
        "Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.\n",
        "Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?\n",
        "It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.\n",
        "Yeah.\n",
        "Shit.  I'm already sorry.\n",
        "Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.\n",

        "You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.\n",

What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright. Absolutely.

Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.\n",

        "There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.\n",

        "You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go. Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.\n",

        "No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...\n",

Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.\n",
        "With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now. Ss-ai!\n",
        "Shit!\n",
        "Fuck procedure.\n",
        " Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?\n",
        "The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.\n",
        "George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.\n",
        "Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.\n",
        "George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...\n",
        "Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?\n",
        "Uh, George... No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?\n",
        "If the drug is here, we must destroy it.\n",
        "Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart. Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.\n",
        "They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt-- I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.\n",
        "George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.\n",
        "Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.\n",
        "Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?\n",
        "No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.\n",
        "Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?\n",
        "We all did.\n",
        "We?  You've taken it?\n",
        "Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The \"high\" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.\n",
        "How potent?\n",
        "... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.\n",
        "The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?\n",
        "No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.\n",
        "No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!\n",
        "You must leave me alone on this.\n",
        "What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it. ... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?\n",
        "Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...\n",
        "... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style. Nothing.\n",
        "What was that about? Thank you.\n",

        "Stop the car!\n",
        "Come on, you won't have to get near the water.\n",
        "Please, I must get out here.\n",
        "Why?\n",
        "Stop the car.\n",
        "Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!\n",
        "To the... to the beach?\n",
        "Well, let's roll, George.\n",
        "She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.\n",
        "George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?\n",
        "She's going to divorce me. A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...\n",
        "Where'd you get this?!! Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?\n",
        "I'm going home.\n",
        "Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.\n",
        "I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves. You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.\n",
        "No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.\n",
        "There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other. Ta ss'trakyona'...\n",
        "Your health... Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?\n",
        "In the other man's rectum.\n",
        "... and so, and so the doctor says, \"If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?\"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be? Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...\n",
        "Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...\n",
        "I appreciate your honesty, George.\n",
        "Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.\n",
        "It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.\n",
        "We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.\n",
        "Was.  Divorced.\n",
        "You are married?\n",
        "Yeah... I know the routine.\n",
        "My wife?  She worries about me.\n",
        "So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she? Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.\n",
        "I believe he is probably lying. When will Strader return?\n",
        "We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.\n",
        "Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.\n",
        "Who is he? Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.\n",
        "Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.\n",
        "And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.\n",
        "Ss'loka'.  It means literally \"small but intelligent creature\".  It loses much in the translation.\n",
        "So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?\n",
        "Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.\n",
        "I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?\n",
        "This is mole.  It's good.\n",
        "Which one is that?  Raw what?\n",
        "Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.\n",
        "I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English? Yeah, sure.  I knew that...\n",
        "If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for. In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...\n",
        "How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?\n",
        "From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.\n",
        "You know that guy? Stay back!  I'm okay.\n",
        "Matthew, you don't have to-- .\n",
        "That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?\n",
        "Your mother mates out of season.\n",
        "Tell me. Screw me?  That can't be right.\n",
        "Screw you.\n",
        "I'll handle it.\n",
        "But I-- .\n",
        "Back off, George.\n",
        "Uh, Matthew...\n",
        "Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?\n",
        "At the end of the bar.\n",
        "Who said that? My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...\n",
        "Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...\n",
        "Why'd I do what?\n",
        "Why did you do it? We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.\n",
        "Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...\n",
        "He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.\n",
        "Did you talk to him?\n",
        "She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.\n",
        "Aw-right.  What about the other guy?\n",
        "A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.\n",
        "Did you learn anything?\n",
        "Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.\n",
        "Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.\n",
        "I believe I should interview the widow alone.\n",
        "So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that \"possible\" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.\n",
        "A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.\n",
        "How the hell do you know that?\n",
        "Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks. And still it fits?\n",
        "Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.\n",
        "And that fits?\n",
        "Get the picture? A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?\n",
        "What is this? Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?\n",
        "Nothing?\n",
        "Nothing.\n",
        "What's this?  What's going on? Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?\n",
        "Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--\n",
        "Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?\n",
        "Well... yes, quite possibly.\n",
        "Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?\n",
        "What is wrong?\n",
        "Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.\n",
        "Yes.\n",
        "Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?\n",
        "The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--\n",
        "The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...\n",
        "There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.\n",
        "Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off? Nice signal, dickwad!\n",
        "Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.\n",
        "With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.\n",
        "His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.\n",
        "Let's talk Hubley.\n",
        "That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like \"ss'ai k'ss\", two words in my language which mean \"excrement\" and \"cranium\".\n",
        "Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care? Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?\n",

        "Please don't go.\n",
        "She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.\n",
        "Why?!\n",
        "He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.\n",
        "Does he know you know? You'll come up with something.\n",

        "Oh.\n",
        "Yeah, that's old, in a tree.\n",
        "Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?\n",
        "He doesn't know about the Day Care.\n",
        "They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.\n",
        "Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.\n",
        "Thank God.\n",
        "The dishes are juiced up, too.\n",
        "Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.\n",
        "Gary.\n",
        "I felt guilty. 'Cause I \"owed so much\" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into -- \"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?\"\n",
        "What'd he say?\n",
        "I told Teddy about you.\n",
        "'Cause their apartments might be bugged?\n",
        "'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?\n",
        "Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.\n",
        "Why were you snooping in my office?\n",
        "I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?\n",
        "Why were you so careless?\n",
        "And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.\n",
        "I don't know --\n",
        "You mean -- break in?\n",
        "Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.\n",
        "Before they kill somebody else, too.\n",
        "Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.\n",
        "It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.\n",
        "You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?\n",
        "But they'd still get the idea, right?\n",
        "It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.\n",
        "A what?\n",
        "We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.\n",
        "He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "How close are you?\n",
        "Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  \"GE joins Outpost in new venture,\" which means NBC is out. \"Disney joins Outpost,\" ABC is out. \"Outpost and Newscorp in new deal,\" Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!\n",
        "Time?\n",
        "Say there's just one \"mole\" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?\n",
        "But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --\n",
        "Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  \"CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001.\"\n",
        "What about \"60 Minutes.\"\n",
        "He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire. Certainly not at my happy home.\n",
        "We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.\n",
        "Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.\n",
        "The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine. There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.\n",
        "Do we post it on the Net? There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.\n",
        "Who can we trust?\n",
        "They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.\n",
        "What about the FBI?\n",
        "No, no. Never.\n",
        "I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.\n",
        "Hmm?\n",
        "...Milo?\n",
        "They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his \"act of revenge.\"\n",
        "He's out of prison?\n",
        "They'd frame him.\n",
        "Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me. Oh yeah?\n",
        "I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you. You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make \"sense.\" I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.\n",
        "But why would they --?\n",
        "It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.\n",
        "The Day Care?\n",
        "You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.\n",
        "Why would you do a thing like --\n",
        "I snuck into #21. She saved my life.\n",
        "That's great. I -- didn't know. Then and now.  But not right now.\n",
        "So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?\n",

        "Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.\n",
        "You're compulsive.\n",
        "Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.\n",
        "Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?\n",
        "Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.\n",
        "\"There is no second place.\" Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?\n",
        "They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?\n",
        "No. Please.\n",

        "What've you got there?\n",
        "No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.\n",

        "Did he say who?\n",
        "That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.\n",
        "Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.\n",

        "Do we always follow Mother's instructions?\n",
        "As per mother's instructions.\n",
        "Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first? That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.\n",

        "Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.\n",
        "My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me: We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  \"Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?\"\n",
        "As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.\n",
        "Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.\n",
        "Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.\n",
        "O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!\n",
        "Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.\n",
        "Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.\n",
        "My husband has convinced me of the contrary.\n",
        "Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.\n",
        "Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.\n",
        "I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.\n",
        "Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.\n",
        "Will we always leave it at this? I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.\n",
        "Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?\n",
        "Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.\n",
        "You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?\n",
        "Then I will respectfully take leave of her.\n",
        "And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?\n",
        "With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.\n",
        "Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are? But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.\n",
        "Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.\n",
        "The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.\n",
        "To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.\n",
        "To make me wretched in two weeks.\n",
        "It is my only object.\n",
        "You want my heart?\n",
        "By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.\n",
        "How so?\n",
        "I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.\n",
        "A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.\n",
        "I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.\n",
        "It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.\n",
        "That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.\n",
        "But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.\n",
        "It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.\n",
        "Your word \"empty\" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.\n",
        "Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.\n",
        "Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.\n",
        "What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?\n",

        "Buttfucks the cabin?\n",
        "Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --\n",
        "So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --\n",

        "They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.\n",

        "Dunbar.\n",
        "And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.\n",

        "At least you and Kendall agree on that.\n",
        "Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "I didn't shoot West...\n",
        "Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.\n",
        "Why do you care?\n",
        "But you will.\n",

        "You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --\n",
        "West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.\n",

        "You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.\n",
        "Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend -- I don't know.\n",
        "Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints? Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --\n",
        "Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.\n",
        "Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.\n",
        "I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.\n",
        "That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.\n",
        "I don't think that has anything to do with --\n",
        "\"Too neat.\" How long have you been an investigator? I lied. Wait for it...\n",

        "Got it.\n",

        "Being back here. Gives me the willies.\n",
        "Something wrong? What point?\n",
        "He's telling the truth, up to a point.\n",
        "Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?\n",
        "You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here. So noted.\n",
        "You're off to a late start.\n",
        "I plan to grow on you.\n",
        "You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?\n",
        "The very same.\n",
        "This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?\n",
        "Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.\n",
        "You're kidding.\n",

        "Something like that. You?\n",

        "You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?\n",
        "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.\n",
        "You made me look like an idiot --\n",
        "I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --\n",

Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?\n",

I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.\n",
        "You don't understand anything.\n",

This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.\n",

        "Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.\n",
        "Okay.\n",
        "Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?\n",
        "And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...\n",
        "Thank you.\n",

        "Why not go to work for me?\n",
        "It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.\n",

        "Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.\n",
        "Thank-Q!\n",
        "No.\n",

        "I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again! Right.\n",

Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...\n",

See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?\n",

        "You saw a lot in one night.\n",
        "I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.\n",
        "Wow. Should you tell my father?\n",
        "OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the \"yellow man\". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.\n",
        "You want to tell me about it?\n",
        "No way. I'm about to blow up.\n",
        "You want a Dairy Queen? It's okay. Don't worry about it.\n",
        "I'm sorry, I didn't...\n",
        "He got a little jealous.\n",
        "What's with Mike? Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?\n",
        "What did you see?\n",
        "Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.\n",
        "Well, how did it go? What happened? Okay, okay. Bye.\n",
        "That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?\n",
        "I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.\n",
        "Okay, thanks.\n",
        "I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?\n",
        "Are you sure?\n",
        "I'm going to wait here until she comes.\n",
        "Yeah.\n",
        "Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?\n",
        "Look, it can wait till Sunday.\n",
        "Okay, yeah, call.\n",
        "Oh, okay, can I call?\n",
        "I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.\n",
        "I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.\n",
        "I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.\n",
        "Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.\n",
        "OK.\n",
        "Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?\n",
        "Yeah, but.\n",
        "It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?\n",
        "It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.\n",
        "Why not?\n",
        "Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it. I'll drink to that.\n",
        "Here's to. An interesting experience. Two.\n",
        "That sounds good. This is not my usual Friday night!\n",
        "Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.\n",
        "Brilliant.\n",
        "First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.\n",
        "What's the plan.\n",
        "Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.\n",
        "Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.\n",
        "Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?\n",
        "I already know. The \"Slow Club\". It's on Route 7.\n",
        "First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.\n",
        "I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?\n",
        "I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.\n",
        "You really want to do this, don't you?\n",
        "Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.\n",
        "Yes. I do.\n",
        "You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?\n",
        "I owe you, since I goofed up this one.\n",
        "Pretty clever. Are you game for more?\n",
        "So, what's next?\n",
        "Yeah.\n",
        "Yeah, if it opens the door.\n",
        "I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?\n",
        "No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.\n",
        "Yes and no. Did you recognize him?\n",
        "I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?\n",
        "Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?\n",
        "Are you alright? Alright. Good luck, yourself.\n",
        "Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.\n",
        "Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.\n",
        "Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name? Let's go.\n",
        "Alright.\n",
        "Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?\n",
        "You've got a point there.\n",
        "Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.\n",
        "I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.\n",
        "You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few \"Awake\" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?\n",
        "What will I say when she comes to the door?\n",
        "Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.\n",
        "Now, how are you going to do that?\n",
        "Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.\n",
        "It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.\n",
        "Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?\n",
        "You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.\n",
        "There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.\n",
        "Alright, now tell me. What is it? Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.\n",
        "I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.\n",
        "I'm here, aren't I?\n",
        "I don't want to cause any trouble.\n",
        "Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.\n",
        "I'd like to talk to you about something.\n",
        "I don't know.\n",
        "You hungry or thirsty, or both? Yeah. Good bye.\n",
        "I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.\n",
        "I guess I'll see you sometime. Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.\n",
        "I've gotta go in.\n",
        "I don't know. He moved away.\n",
        "What happened to him?\n",
        "It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.\n",
        "Still, it must be kinda rough.\n",
        "I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.\n",
        "Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?\n",
        "You really do hear a lot, don't you?\n",
        "My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.\n",
        "Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?\n",
        "I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.\n",
        "Did they find out anything when they questioned her?\n",
        "I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.\n",
        "Where are they?\n",
        "That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching. Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.\n",
        "I guess you have to get back home soon?\n",
        "Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.\n",
        "It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?\n",
        "Maybe so.\n",
        "The ear is from a missing person maybe?\n",
        "No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.\n",
        "Were all these people questioned this afternoon?\n",
        "There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.\n",
        "Do you know who was brought in for questioning?\n",
        "I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.\n",
        "Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?\n",
        "Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? \n",
        "What do you know about the ear? Anything?\n",
        "That's too bad.\n",
        "I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.\n",
        "Yeah. What are you doing now?\n",
        "What else is new? Right?\n",

        "That's a long time to be in jail.\n",
        "We said 48 hours.\n",
        "He went back for his brother.\n",
        "He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.\n",

        "After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.\n",
        "Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.\n",
        "This was in fourth grade.\n",
        "See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.\n",
        "Don't worry about it, Bob.\n",
        "See, now we've got a plan.\n",
        "Bob?\n",
        "Obviously. That's a given.\n",
        "As long as he gets out OK.\n",
        "Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.\n",
        "No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.\n",
        "He needs to hire an attorney. No kidding.\n",
        "She's from Cuba. On the left.\n",
        "Which one was that?\n",
        "No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.\n",
        "They don't?\n",
        "No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.\n",
        "Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?\n",
        "What. What's the matter?\n",
        "What the fuck is going on here?\n",
        "Sure.\n",
        "May I have a word with you, please? Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.\n",
        "Inez, this is --\n",
        "Hi.\n",
        "This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.\n",
        "No. We didn't.\n",
        "I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.\n",
        "Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?\n",
        "No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.\n",
        "Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.\n",
        "Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?\n",
        "True.\n",
        "Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.\n",
        "Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.\n",
        "It's not a plan. It's just --\n",
        "Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.\n",
        "I know. But once you get inside you're home free.\n",
        "Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.\n",
        "It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.\n",
        "No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.\n",
        "Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts. Bob?\n",
        "You owe me fifty bucks. On your marks...  Get set go.\n",
        "OK. Go ahead.\n",
        "I'll say it.\n",
        "I'll just say it.\n",
        "You were spoiled rotten.\n",
        "Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.\n",
        "That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.\n",
        "You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.\n",
        "Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes. Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.\n",
        "They obviously weren't designed for racing.\n",
        "What about them?\n",
        "Look at the treads on those.\n",
        "Yes, they are.\n",
        "Dignan, those aren't running shoes.\n",
        "See if mine are in there. Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...\n",
        "I keep it for emergencies.\n",
        "Well, then cut it in half.\n",
        "I don't want to use it.\n",
        "She's not going to notice, Anthony.\n",
        "Because my mom gets the bill.\n",
        "Why not?\n",
        "I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.\n",
        "Can I get that credit card from you?\n",
        "Don't even say it, man.\n",
        "I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --\n",
        "He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.\n",
        "Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.\n",
        "What do you think?\n",
        "What's wrong with him? Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.\n",
        "Like he would find Dignan. One day.\n",
        "Yeah.\n",
        "Like he meant it.\n",
        "I swear to God. In a very quiet voice. Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.\n",
        "What about what that guy said?\n",

        "Way to go, Bob! Bob, I've got nightmares.\n",

        "How did you get in?\n",
        "No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.\n",
        "All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there. Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.\n",
        "You can believe that if you want to.\n",
        "Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?\n",
        "Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.\n",
        "Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.\n",
        "I don't think I will, Rick.\n",
        "Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.\n",
        "Yes.\n",
        "Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?\n",
        "It doesn't matter.\n",
        "I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night. Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, \"Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid,\" it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?\n",
        "It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.\n",
        "Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.\n",
        "I don't know the finish yet.\n",
        "Has it got a wow finish?\n",
        "Can I tell you a story, Rick?\n",
        "Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.\n",
        "I didn't count the days.\n",
        "Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?\n",
        "Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.\n",
        "It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. \"Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop.\"\n",
        "I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.\n",
        "Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.\n",
        "Please.\n",
        "Especially tonight.\n",
        "No. No, Rick. Not tonight.\n",
        "Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.\n",
        "I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...\n",
        "Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?\n",
        "Oh, darling!\n",
        "Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?\n",
        "That's too far ahead to plan.\n",
        "All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?\n",
        "No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?\n",

        "But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.\n",

        "Strange. I know so very little about you.\n",
        "Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.\n",

        "My German's a little rusty. I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.\n",
        "Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here. Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.\n",
        "I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said \"no questions.\"\n",

        "He'll take one.\n",
        "He is traveling with a lady.\n",
        "Why two?\n",
        "Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.\n",

        "His escape.\n",
        "Manages what?\n",
        "It'll be interesting to see how he manages.\n",
        "It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.\n",
        "Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.\n",
        "Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.\n",

        "Victor Laszlo.\n",
        "Yeah? What's his name?\n",

        "I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.\n",
        "Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.\n",
        "Yeah? Have a brandy?\n",
        "How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice. Perhaps not.\n",
        "I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency. Our entertainment is enough.\n",

Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen...

        "Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.\n",
        "He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?\n",
        "...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.\n",
        "Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?\n",
        "It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear. ...Yes, Sir.\n",
        "Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.\n",
        "Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.\n",
        "Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?\n",
        "Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?\n",
        "Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.\n",
        "Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.\n",
        "No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say \"Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means,\" I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.\n",
        "I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.\n",
        "I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.\n",
        "Well sir, perhaps I should explain...\n",
        "A few words? I thought he was imbecile?\n",
        "He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.\n",
        "Good! How is the patient?\n",
        "Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.\n",
        "Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?\n",
        "Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?\n",
        "I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.\n",
        "No, more of an acquaintance.\n",
        "Oh, is he a friend of yours?\n",
        "Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.\n",
        "What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.\n",
        "Yes sir.\n",
        "Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?\n",
        "Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.\n",
        "Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?\n",
        "No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.\n",
        "A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious? Indeed!\n",

        "So go. No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.\n",
        "I think we should go.\n",
        "Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.\n",
        "Naomi.\n",
        "Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?\n",
        "It's dark.\n",
        "I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.\n",
        "I knew.\n",
        "I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.\n",
        "I hesitated for what seemed like forever.\n",
        "C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off. It's freezing out here.\n",
        "What are you doing?\n",
        "Cool. At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.\n",
        "Female.\n",
        "Male or female? Oh.\n",
        "I do sort of live with somebody though.\n",
        "Let's move into this neighborhood.\n",
        "Um, no.\n",
        "I wish we did. You married? Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.\n",
        "Yeah, yeah. It goes \"Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines\"?\n",
        "Do you know her poem that starts \"Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live... Yeah, maybe.\n",
        "Seems too coincidental that way.\n",
        "I think, before.\n",
        "Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?\n",
        "Me too. There's this poem --\n",
        "I think she's great.\n",
        "Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.\n",
        "I love her.\n",
        "Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?\n",
        "Okay.\n",
        "I'll give you a couple. See what you think.\n",
        "yeah?\n",
        "You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.\n",
        "I don't think I've slept in a year.\n",
        "But my sleeping is really fucked up.\n",
        "I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.\n",
        "No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.\n",
        "Enjoy it. Say good-bye.\n",
        "What do we do?\n",
        "I know.\n",
        "This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.\n",
        "Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.\n",
        "Yeah, like that.\n",
        "You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing? I'm Joel.\n",
        "Oh God, how horrid.\n",
        "And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.\n",
        "I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?\n",
        "You said --\n",
        "Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.\n",
        "You know what I did. Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?\n",
        "I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.\n",
        "Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.\n",
        "I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.\n",
        "You said... Hi.\n",
        "Hi there. Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.\n",
        "It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.\n",
        "I know.\n",
        "I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.\n",
        "Probably.\n",
        "You had the whole human race pegged.\n",
        "I had you pegged, didn't I?\n",
        "I remember that speech really well.\n",
        "Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours. So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.\n",
        "Okay.\n",
        "Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.\n",
        "Not yet. Not married.\n",
        "Well, you're married.\n",
        "I'd like to... take you out or something.\n",
        "Yeah?\n",
        "Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.\n",
        "I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.\n",
        "I did it. I guess that means something.\n",
        "Is that what you want?\n",
        "I told her today I need to end it.\n",
        "Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.\n",
        "It's very late.\n",
        "Come up and see me... now.\n",
        "I dropped you off after. You said -- And I didn't have an argument.\n",
        "So what. Infatuation is good, too.\n",
        "I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said: I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.\n",
        "But you weren't. I could tell.\n",
        "I'm sure, I said.\n",
        "I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.\n",
        "We did talk about Naomi.\n",
        "I'll buy that. Black's always good.\n",
        "Right. Something black though. No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.\n",
        "Egad, were you horrified?\n",
        "God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.\n",
        "What was I wearing?\n",
        "Yeah.\n",
        "Naomi, I guess.\n",
        "Do you remember what we talked about?\n",
        "This is our first \"date\" date.\n",
        "I want to enjoy my little time left with you.\n",
        "Yeah.\n",
        "I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.\n",
        "I love it!\n",
        "I scoured the city for it.\n",
        "Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!\n",
        "Happy Birthday. I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --\n",
        "Joel!\n",
        "This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.\n",
        "Look at you, cutey! What are we doing? Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?\n",
        "They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.\n",
        "Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.\n",
        "Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.\n",
        "But can't you see... I love you, Antoine. Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.\n",
        "He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!\n",
        "Really? Is he cute?\n",
        "There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "There's this guy!\n",
        "-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?\n",
        "I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --\n",
        "You remember what happened next?\n",
        "I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.\n",
        "You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over. Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.\n",
        "I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...\n",
        "I'm right here.\n",
        "I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.\n",
        "Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.\n",
        "What do you mean?\n",
        "What if you hide me?\n",
        "I don't know.\n",
        "Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?\n",
        "I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.\n",
        "Oh?\n",
        "Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!\n",
        "Such a beautiful view. It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, \"It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.\"\n",
        "No.\n",
        "Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?\n",
        "Yeah, Tangerine?\n",
        "Joely...\n",
        "No. Thanks.\n",
        "More? Joel, you're a liar.\n",
        "I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.\n",
        "I want to know you.\n",
        "No, it isn't that.\n",
        "You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me. You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --\n",
        "You're drunk.\n",
        "Would you get me another, Joely?\n",
        "So, um --\n",
        "It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!\n",
        "Oh, thank God. It's going.\n",
        "I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!\n",
        "Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --\n",
        "You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it! Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!\n",
        "I don't want to talk about this here.\n",
        "What?!\n",
        "Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?\n",
        "You're not ready.\n",
        "I don't think we're ready.\n",
        "No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.\n",
        "Let's talk about it later.\n",
        "I want to have a baby.\n",
        "Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?\n",
        "I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.\n",
        "Where are you going?\n",
        "How can you watch this crap?\n",
        "Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.\n",
        "Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.\n",
        "Let me drive you home. No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?\n",
        "A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight? Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.\n",
        "I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody. Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.\n",
        "...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.\n",
        "I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic. It's three.\n",
        "Yo ho ho! You didn't say anything about my hair.\n",
        "How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone? Okay.\n",
        "Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.\n",
        "Tomorrow?\n",
        "When?\n",
        "Yeah.\n",
        "You'll call me, right?\n",
        "So, I enjoyed meeting you. Yes.\n",
        "I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that. Okay.\n",
        "I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...\n",
        "You should stay.\n",
        "Sounds good. But right now I should go.\n",
        "I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and -- Yeah? Oh, great!\n",
        "Okay.\n",
        "I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.\n",
        "I think so.\n",
        "Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?\n",
        "That's scary sounding.\n",
        "That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.\n",
        "Oh, yeah.\n",
        "Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph. I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...\n",
        "No, not at all.\n",
        "I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?\n",
        "No.\n",
        "You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?\n",
        "Yeah.\n",
        "Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?\n",
        "Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --\n",
        "What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?\n",
        "Yeah.\n",
        "And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?\n",
        "Thanks.\n",
        "I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.\n",
        "I do have a tendency to use that word too much.\n",
        "You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.\n",
        "I think about that.\n",
        "Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.\n",
        "Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.\n",
        "It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you? But I think I am. I like to think I am.\n",
        "Yeah, I guess.\n",
        "Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?\n",
        "Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.\n",
        "Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?\n",
        "I don't know.\n",
        "Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?\n",
        "Yeah?\n",
        "Y'know, I'm sort of psychic. Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.\n",
        "Thanks.\n",
        "I know a man who needs a refill.\n",
        "No. I --\n",
        "No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?\n",
        "Well, I should probably get going.\n",
        "I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.\n",
        "You just say. I'm not really --\n",
        "You pick it.\n",
        "What do you want to hear? No, I'm okay for now.\n",
        "Ready for another? Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.\n",
        "I'm fine.\n",
        "God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.\n",
        "Cheers.\n",
        "I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!\n",
        "It's pretty.\n",
        "Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?\n",
        "Frost?\n",
        "Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.\n",
        "I don't know.\n",
        "Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?\n",
        "Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.\n",
        "This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.\n",
        "Very much.\n",
        "You like that? Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.\n",
        "Um --\n",
        "Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --\n",
        "Take care.\n",
        "Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.\n",
        "Well, I wouldn't want to be --\n",
        "Thanks very much. That was very nice of you. I'm just a bit of a wreck. \"I sleep in your hat\" makes me cry.  Me.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "Remember? \"And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat...\"  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.\n",
        "Sort of, um...\n",
        "The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. \"Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen.\" Remember?\n",
        "Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --\n",
        "Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.\n",
        "I like to read.\n",
        "So you like bookstores, huh?\n",
        "It's okay. I didn't think you were.\n",
        "Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really. Wilmont. Near the high school.\n",
        "Yeah.\n",
        "You know Wilmont?\n",
        "I'm not a stalker.\n",
        "You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.\n",
        "Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.\n",
        "You're not a stalker or anything, right?\n",
        "Where do you live?\n",
        "Yeah?\n",
        "It's okay.\n",
        "I don't want to take you out of your way.\n",
        "You're sure? It's cold.\n",
        "No, that's okay. Thanks, though.\n",
        "Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.\n",

        "Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve. The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.\n",

It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.\n",

Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.\n",

As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...

That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.\n",

Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?\n",

        "It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.\n",
        "I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.\n",
        "It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.\n",
        "I think I see it pretty well.\n",
        "Murphy, don't you see what's happening?\n",
        "I didn't want it to turn out this way.\n",
        "And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?\n",
        "The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.\n",
        "So you killed them?\n",
        "It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.\n",
        "You killed them. Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.\n",
        "We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.\n",

        "We hit land.\n",
        "What happened?\n",
        "It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.\n",
        "If the weather holds it might not be so bad.\n",
        "Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water. Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.\n",
        "They went crazy. Maybe it was more than that.\n",
        "Over the gold.\n",
        "Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. \"Like wild dogs.\"\n",
        "What do you think? Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.\n",
        "What do we do with him? Right here.\n",

        "I don't know.\n",
        "What's that supposed to mean?\n",
        "She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave. More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.\n",
        "That much I think we've already established.\n",
        "Something bad happened here, Murphy.\n",
        "Victims of what?\n",
        "No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.\n",
        "Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.\n",
        "What happened.\n",
        "Showing you what?\n",
        "Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me. I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.\n",
        "What, like some kind of ghost?\n",
        "No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.\n",
        "Not our mystery guest again.\n",
        "When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.\n",
        "I don't know, are we?\n",
        "Are we smart enough to avoid that?\n",
        "Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.\n",
        "The what?\n",
        "I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?\n",

        "Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.\n",
        "But where's the damage?\n",
        "The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.\n",
        "Collision? With what?\n",
        "\"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made.\"\n",
        "Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.\n",
        "The same day she supposedly went down.\n",
        "February first.\n",
        "\"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill.\" But, who -- ?\n",
        "Smashed it up pretty bad. Somebody took it out of commission last night.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "The ah... the radio's out.\n",
        "Only something must've gone wrong.\n",
        "If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.\n",
        "You're saying they mutinied for the gold?\n",
        "Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.\n",
        "They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.\n",
        "No. I'll try again later.\n",
        "Same. Any luck?\n",

        "Guess that'd be me. Again.\n",
        "We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.\n",
        "So, we find this guy and make a deal with him. It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.\n",

        "Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.\n",
        "So what did happen?\n",
        "She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.\n",
        "Nope.\n",
        "Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?\n",
        "Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.\n",
        "Her destination was Halifax, yeah.\n",
        "She was sailing up north, right?\n",
        "Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.\n",
        "What'd you find up there?\n",
        "Yeah. Thanks.\n",
        "Coffee? They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.\n",
        "The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try. Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.\n",

        "Oh, hi...\n",
        "Hi, it's me...\n",
        "Uh... hello?\n",
        "Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!\n",
        "How can you be so sure?\n",
        "Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!\n",
        "Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.\n",
        "That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?\n",
        "It's just somebody's idea of a joke...\n",
        "Wow!  What was that all about?\n",
        "Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...\n",
        "Aren't you going to get that?\n",
        "Who knows?\n",
        "I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?\n",
        "I won't even dignify that with a response.\n",
        "Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?\n",
        "Why?\n",
        "Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.\n",
        "Oh yeah?\n",
        "Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...\n",
        "Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.\n",
        "I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.\n",
        "I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.\n",
        "Never...\n",
        "Really?\n",
        "I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!\n",
        "That's the spirit!\n",
        "Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...\n",
        "Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.\n",
        "What, like a girdle?\n",
        "Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...\n",
        "What is that?\n",
        "It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...\n",
        "Are you okay?\n",
        "Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...\n",
        "No, Doofus... blow it out!\n",
        "Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...\n",
        "You can open your eyes now. Don't you trust me, Seymour?\n",
        "I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --\n",
        "I promise I'll take good care of it.\n",
        "What? Why?\n",
        "Hey, can I borrow this?\n",
        "No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...\n",
        "So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?\n",
        "I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?\n",
        "Yeah, but still...\n",
        "Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...\n",
        "Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.\n",
        "Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.\n",
        "What are you, a fry cook or something?\n",
        "For nineteen years...\n",
        "You work at Cook's Chicken?\n",
        "Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them... Yeah, well \"Cook's\" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named \"The Coon Chicken Inn\" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.\n",
        "\"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS\"!\n",
        "Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?\n",
        "What, are you a klansman or something?\n",
        "What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.\n",
        "What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this? I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...\n",
        "If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?\n",
        "Wow, this is so cool...\n",
        "\"Yet.\"\n",
        "It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.\n",
        "I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some -- Hooray for me.\n",
        "I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...\n",
        "But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...\n",
        "Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...\n",
        "Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.\n",
        "It's not hopeless...\n",
        "Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.\n",
        "We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.\n",
        "Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet. Jesus...\n",
        "I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.\n",
        "What did you tell that girl?\n",
        "Just wait here.\n",
        "Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...\n",
        "Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?\n",
        "Yes, that would certainly do...\n",
        "Jesus, Seymour.\n",
        "What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!? I'm not holding my breath in that department.\n",
        "This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.\n",
        "I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!\n",
        "So, why did you bring this along?\n",
        "That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...\n",
        "Relax, Seymour, relax... C'mon, Seymour, please?\n",
        "Uh, I don't have much money with me right now. These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.\n",
        "Look at this -- \"Lollipop Lolitas\" - isn't child pornography totally illegal? OH MY GOD!\n",
        "Shh!\n",
        "Wow! Look at all these creeps! Fine, I'll go by myself then...\n",
        "I really don't think it's a good idea.\n",
        "PLEASE? We have to!\n",
        "I don't think so...\n",
        "We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!\n",
        "I - I'd really rather not...\n",
        "Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?\n",
        "Yeah, sure... very funny....\n",
        "Oh my god! We have to go in here!\n",
        "Well are --\n",
        "Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.\n",
        "So is that your boyfriend?\n",
        "Let's just say \"music\" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second...\n",
        "Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...\n",
        "Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.\n",
        "Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?\n",
        "We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.\n",
        "I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...\n",
        "Every guy has a type!\n",
        "I'm just not one of those guys who has a \"type\"...\n",
        "C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?\n",
        "Jesus!\n",
        "Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?\n",
        "I really didn't get a good look at her.\n",
        "But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?\n",
        "I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...\n",
        "What about her? Would you go out with her?\n",
        "Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --\n",
        "Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!\n",
        "I appreciate the offer but you really don't --\n",
        "I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!\n",
        "Yeah, well...\n",
        "I'm totally serious!\n",
        "Good luck...\n",
        "No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...\n",
        "Oh, right...\n",
        "I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!\n",
        "Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.\n",
        "No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.\n",
        "You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.\n",
        "Oh, come on! What are you talking about?\n",
        "Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.\n",
        "God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!\n",
        "I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...\n",
        "Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!\n",
        "Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...\n",
        "Really? Can I see it?\n",
        "Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.\n",
        "You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?\n",
        "I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.\n",
        "What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks? Hey, I was only kidding!\n",
        "NO!!!\n",
        "Oops! I dropped it!\n",
        "Watch my stuff.\n",
        "Yeah, sure, I guess...\n",
        "Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...\n",
        "Wow!\n",
        "The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.\n",
        "Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, \"Devil Got My Woman\" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?\n",
        "So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?\n",
        "Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like -- Okay.\n",
        "A dollar seventy-five.\n",
        "How much is it? Wow!\n",
        "This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue. Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.\n",
        "Is this one any good?\n",
        "Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.\n",
        "Sure, I guess.\n",
        "There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?\n",
        "Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...\n",
        "Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s? I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect \"foreign.\"\n",

        "Why?\n",

        "All right then! Yes!\n",

        "No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.\n",
        "But you're not enrolled.\n",
        "Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --\n",

        "That woman. The older woman.\n",
        "What?\n",

        "You do?\n",
        "I do.\n",

        "Yes.\n",
        "Was she married or something?\n",

        "Of course not.\n",
        "Benjamin -- do they know you?\n",

        "Benjamin -- Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.\n",
        "Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know. Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.\n",

        "No, I couldn't.\n",
        "Listen -- could you stop crying, please? No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.\n",
        "Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.\n",
        "This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.\n",

        "Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?\n",
        "I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?\n",
        "How do you think.\n",
        "Well how did it happen?\n",
        "Kind of.\n",
        "But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then. Art?\n",
        "Art.\n",
        "Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?\n",
        "Why are you asking me all this?\n",
        "What was your major?\n",
        "Yes.\n",
        "At college.\n",
        "Yes.\n",
        "And you were a student also. Was he a law student at the time?\n",
        "Not particularly.\n",
        "I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?\n",
        "What?\n",
        "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?\n",
        "All right. Now let's get to bed.\n",
        "Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...\n",
        "Are you shocked?\n",
        "Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?\n",
        "Don't tell Elaine.\n",
        "I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?\n",
        "Think real hard, Benjamin.\n",
        "Well I can't.\n",
        "See if you can guess.\n",
        "Why did you do that? Well, wait a minute. You married him.\n",
        "I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --\n",
        "What?\n",
        "No.\n",
        "Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him. I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.\n",
        "Is it?\n",
        "Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?\n",
        "I don't.\n",
        "Well how do you feel about him, then?\n",
        "No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.\n",
        "But you don't hate him.\n",
        "Not exactly.\n",
        "Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.\n",
        "We've talked enough, Benjamin.\n",
        "So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --\n",
        "Is it?\n",
        "Man, is this interesting.\n",
        "On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.\n",
        "How many times a year.\n",
        "Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.\n",
        "You have not slept with your husband for five years?\n",
        "No.\n",
        "Oh no. Are you kidding me?\n",
        "About five years.\n",
        "Well how long has this been going on.\n",
        "No we don't.\n",
        "So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.\n",
        "We don't.\n",
        "Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.\n",
        "Thank you.\n",
        "Right.\n",
        "Can I undress and talk at the same time?\n",
        "Now let's keep going here.\n",
        "Calm down, Benjamin.\n",
        "We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "We're talking.\n",
        "The driveway's on my side of the house.\n",
        "But what about the noise from the car. What if --\n",
        "Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.\n",
        "Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.\n",
        "Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.\n",
        "Always?\n",
        "He's asleep.\n",
        "What do you say to him? You walk right out the door.\n",
        "I walk out.\n",
        "How do you get out of the house? There's no risk?\n",
        "There isn't any.\n",
        "I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.\n",
        "Him?\n",
        "Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "There!\n",
        "Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until -- I don't remember.\n",
        "What novel did you read.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "What one.\n",
        "I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.\n",
        "Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.\n",
        "Do you want to hear it or not? I got up.\n",
        "Yes I do.\n",
        "Do you really want me to?\n",
        "No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.\n",
        "Can I take off my clothes now? I don't.\n",
        "Then why do you want to talk about it?\n",
        "No.\n",
        "You're not interested in art?\n",
        "Neither.\n",
        "Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art. Art. Well what do you want to know about it.\n",
        "Go ahead then.\n",
        "Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.\n",
        "Don't you?\n",
        "Oh.\n",
        "You start it off. I don't know anything about it.\n",
        "Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.\n",
        "How about art.\n",
        "Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic. Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --\n",
        "Well?\n",
        "Oh my God.\n",
        "Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?\n",
        "Anything. Anything at all.\n",
        "Well what do you want to talk about?\n",
        "I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?\n",
        "Are you tired of it?\n",
        "All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.\n",
        "Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.\n",
        "Good. I mean are we dead or something?\n",
        "If you want.\n",
        "Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time? INADEQUATE!\n",
        "-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --\n",
        "Wait a minute.\n",
        "That you're afraid --\n",
        "Who said it was my first time?\n",
        "On your first time --\n",
        "Wait a minute!\n",
        "It's nothing to be ashamed of --\n",
        "Are you kidding?\n",
        "You can admit that, can't you?\n",
        "That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.\n",
        "It is, isn't it? It is your first time.\n",
        "Is this -- what?\n",
        "Benjamin, is this your first time?\n",
        "No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.\n",
        "Are you afraid of me?\n",
        "Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --\n",
        "Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?\n",
        "This is all terribly wrong.\n",
        "You what?\n",
        "Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.\n",
        "Would this be easier for you in the dark?\n",
        "You're welcome.\n",
        "Thank you.\n",
        "Okay.\n",
        "Either one will be fine.\n",
        "Wood or wire? They have both.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "Oh -- yes. Wood?\n",
        "A hanger.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "Will you bring me a hanger?\n",
        "Oh -- sure. Thank you.\n",
        "Why don't you watch?\n",
        "Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.\n",
        "I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?\n",
        "Yes?\n",
        "Benjamin.\n",
        "Well. You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.\n",
        "Thank you.\n",
        "Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.\n",
        "The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "The number.\n",
        "Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --\n",
        "Yes.\n",
        "To tell you?\n",
        "Isn't there something you want to tell me?\n",
        "Yes?\n",
        "Benjamin.\n",
        "Well -- goodbye then --\n",
        "I'll be up in five minutes.\n",
        "Yes -- I think that would be good.\n",
        "Well -- do you want to go up first?\n",
        "But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --\n",
        "That's fine.\n",
        "I got a single room. Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.\n",
        "Why don't you get it.\n",
        "Well -- I don't know.\n",
        "Yes.\n",
        "Now?\n",
        "Do you want to get it now?\n",
        "You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.\n",
        "Do you want me to get it?\n",
        "Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.\n",
        "Do you want to?\n",
        "I haven't. No.\n",
        "Have you gotten us a room yet?\n",
        "What?\n",
        "Did you get us a room?\n",
        "Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --\n",
        "You don't have to be so nervous, you know. Waiter!\n",
        "He didn't see me. A drink? Of course.\n",
        "May I have a drink?\n",
        "Very well. Thank you.\n",
        "How are you?\n",
        "Of course.\n",
        "May I sit down?\n",
        "Oh. Hello. Hello.\n",
        "Hello, Benjamin. Thank you for taking me home.\n",
        "Yes.\n",
        "Benjamin?\n",
        "I've got to go.\n",
        "Yes, I do. Because I find you very attractive and any time --\n",
        "Yes. Yes. Let me out!\n",
        "Do you understand what I said?\n",
        "Let me out!\n",
        "If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.\n",
        "Oh my God.\n",
        "Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --\n",
        "Jesus Christ!\n",
        "I want to say something first.\n",
        "Get away from that door.\n",
        "Don't be nervous. On that chair in the hall.\n",
        "Where is it?\n",
        "I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?\n",
        "I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.\n",
        "Is that what you're trying to tell me?\n",
        "What?\n",
        "Would you like me to seduce you?\n",
        "Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --\n",
        "Why is it?\n",
        "I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.\n",
        "Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --\n",
        "But they would! Don't you see?\n",
        "I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --\n",
        "Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.\n",
        "Don't you think he trusts us together?\n",
        "Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?\n",
        "What if he did?\n",
        "But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now? Yes, I have --\n",
        "Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?\n",
        "Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.\n",
        "Then why do you keep running away?\n",
        "I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.\n",
        "What are you so scared of?\n",
        "Right.\n",
        "Thank you. Come on.\n",
        "I know that. But I'm --\n",
        "Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.\n",
        "No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.\n",
        "If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --\n",
        "I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.\n",
        "Won't you unzip my dress?\n",
        "Oh. Well, goodnight.\n",
        "I think I'll go to bed. Will you unzip my dress?\n",
        "Yes?\n",
        "Benjamin?\n",
        "I don't remember her as having brown eyes. Very much.\n",
        "We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?\n",
        "No.\n",
        "Yes.\n",
        "Her portrait?\n",
        "Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?\n",
        "What is wrong with me?\n",
        "We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.\n",
        "Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.\n",
        "All right. Now finish your drink.\n",
        "Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.\n",
        "Sit down.\n",
        "It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.\n",
        "It's all right.\n",
        "Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?\n",
        "Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --\n",
        "Aren't you? Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.\n",
        "So?\n",
        "For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.\n",
        "Well I don't know.\n",
        "What do you think?\n",
        "Like what?\n",
        "I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --\n",
        "What's wrong?\n",
        "Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.\n",
        "Pardon?\n",
        "Oh my God.\n",
        "My husband will be back quite late.\n",
        "What?\n",
        "No.\n",
        "Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --\n",
        "Sit down, Benjamin.\n",
        "Look -- I think I should be going --\n",
        "Did you know that?\n",
        "What?\n",
        "Did you know I was an alcoholic?\n",
        "Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.\n",
        "You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.\n",
        "What do you mean?\n",
        "What do you think of me? I'm very neurotic.\n",
        "Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?\n",
        "Yes.\n",
        "Are you always this much afraid of being alone? No.\n",
        "Drink? I don't know.\n",
        "When is he coming back?\n",
        "Please wait till my husband gets home.\n",
        "Why not?\n",
        "Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house. What do you drink?\n",
        "All right then. Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?\n",
        "What do you drink? Bourbon? Please.\n",
        "But it's light in there now.\n",
        "Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house. Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.\n",
        "What for?\n",
        "I want you to come in till I get the lights on.\n",
        "What?\n",

        "What?\n",
